"Question about paying taxes. Please someone help answer this.
So as an American we’re supposed to pay a capital gains tax on our crypto gains when we sell.
For me to best explain what I’m trying to figure out I figured it was easiest to give you my question within this hypothetical situation.
So... In December buy 100 Bitcoin @ $400 Then In July I buy 100 Bitcoin @ $1000
In September I sell 20 of my bitcoin. Bitcoin in September is worth $2000
My 100 Bitcoin from December has a capital gain of $1600 My 100 Bitcoin from July has a gain of $1000
Basically because I don’t get to choose which bitcoin I am withdrawing am I paying taxes on $1000 gain or $1600 gain?",
"SALT is quite an interesting idea, but the way the ICO was set up kind of rubbed me the wrong way. They held pre-ICOs for insiders only where 35 million were sold at $0.25 and 5 million sold at $0.75. The total supply is 120 million. So they sold off 1/3 of their supply for an average of $0.31, to private investors.
I think this is why the price is taking a hit and will continue to sink. People who brought in around $12 paid 40x what the original private investors paid. The whole thing is shady to me, so I'm staying away from it. Such a shame though, it was a promising idea.
